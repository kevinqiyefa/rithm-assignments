# React Router Dog Finder

Build an app in which you have a single `Route` component that renders details on the dog - this details component should display a dog's information based on props passed to it.

The routes look like this:

- `/dogs` is the homepage and shows all three dogs
- Clicking on a dog from the homepage takes you to that dog's route. For example clicking on Whiskey will take you to `/dogs/whiskey`.
- `/` and every other endpoint not listed should redirect you to `/dogs`.

Here's an image of what the app looks like. It should look the same once you've refactored it!
